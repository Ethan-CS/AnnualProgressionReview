This Annual Progress Report, the first of our PhD programme, serves to detail the work we have done in the first year of our research. We first outline the research title we have worked under and outline the structure of the discussion to follow.

\subsection{Thesis Statement}

Our working research title is {\it game-theoretic and probabilistic methods applied to spatial network models of contagion.} Over the past year, we have spent a large portion of time reading and developing ideas related to graph models of contagion, such as {\scshape Firefighter} and similar games on graphs that are already used to model contagion (or could fit in such a context easily). We have also explored game theory to understand optimal strategies and probabilistic methods in order to adapt the games we have studied to stochastic contexts. Such a broad approach has meant that we have a wide range of tools available to us in understanding and developing models of disease and other contagions.

\subsection{Report Roadmap}

Our research over the past year has focused into two main strands: a formal, mathematical approach and an experimental approach. Our motivation for this two-pronged {\it modus operandi} is to ultimately develop a model for disease spread formally, using dynamical system and graph theoretic approaches, which we then use an experimental implementation to algorithmically explore different approaches to the model, for instance in examining candidates for theoretically optimal public health strategies in the context of a disease. To explain this work in detail, we will begin this report by discussing the literature examined in the past year, with particular focus on any papers that have proved foundational to our own work. This literature review section will provide background to our research so far, which is discussed in the section that follows it. We will then outline the direction we hope to take this initial work moving forward and detail milestones we hope to reach in the coming year.
