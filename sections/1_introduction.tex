This Annual Progress Report, the first of our PhD programme, serves to detail the work we have done in the first year of our research.

\subsection{Thesis Statement}

Our working research title is {\it game-theoretic and probabilistic methods applied to spatial network models of contagion.} Over the past year, we have spent time reading and developing ideas related to ``spatial network models of contagion," in particular {\scshape Firefighter} and similar games on graphs that are used to model contagion, in order to understand the original formulations of these graph problems and the results already available for them. We have also explored ideas related to game theory to understand optimal strategies and ways to understand games on graphs from this perspective and probabilistic methods in order to adapt the games we have studied to stochastic contexts. Such a broad approach has meant that we have a wide range of tools available to us in understanding and developing models of disease and other contagions.

\subsection{Report Roadmap}

We will begin by discussing the literature examined in the past year, with particular focus on some key papers we have spent considerable time understanding and extending results. This literature review section will provide background to the work done so far, which is discussed in the section that follows it. There, we will explain the work done over the past year as a result of our preliminary research. We will then outline the direction we hope to take this initial work and detail milestones we hope to reach in the coming year.
