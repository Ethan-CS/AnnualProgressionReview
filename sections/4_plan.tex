\subsection{Goals}

Over the next year, we hope to extend the two strands of work we have been pursuing with a number of goals and milestones in mind. In the more formal, mathematical side of our work, we aim to achieve the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Formalise a probabilistic, agency-based graph model of disease that can be implemented in the PRISM model checking language.
	\item Complete and verify the equations generation work that we have started over the last year and write down the algorithmic approach used.
	\item Explore further formal approaches to agency-based modelling that could be used to formulate models or understand better our existing models (for instance, integer programming approaches or model-checking using PRISM).
\end{itemize}
Moreover, in the experimental side of our work, we aim to achieve the following:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Further generalise the current implementation to accept further parameters and output requested results.
	\item Implement, test and explore further defence strategies in the implementation, using this to reason about optimal defence candidates in different contexts.
	\item Write down a series of (provable) statements regarding defence strategies in this implementation on various graph classes.
	\item Use real-world data to model different epidemic scenarios and contextualise defence strategies.
\end{itemize}

Some significant milestones we aim to reach are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Submit a conference abstract or poster.
	\item Write and submit a paper to a journal or conference.
	\item Request, write and present a talk for the FATA research section in the department in a postgraduate slot in the Autumn of 2021.
\end{itemize}
Of course, the first two of these milestones are very general - we are in the process of examining potential candidate venues for presentation of this area of work and we would be grateful for any advice on this.
